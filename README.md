# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model<br/>

The Heart Disease Prediction Model is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on medical and lifestyle-related factors. This model aims to assist healthcare professionals and researchers by providing early warnings and supporting preventive healthcare measures.<br/>

🛠️ Technologies Used<br/>
Programming Language: Python<br/>
Libraries & Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn<br/>
Algorithm: Logistic Regression<br/>
Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset<br/>

⚙️ Key Features<br/>
✔ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data for better model accuracy.<br/>
✔ Feature Engineering: Selecting key attributes affecting heart disease.<br/>
✔ Machine Learning Model: Using Logistic Regression to classify individuals as high-risk or low-risk.<br/>
✔ Performance Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score.<br/>
✔ Visualization: Graphical representation of important patterns in the dataset.<br/>

🎯 Objective<br/>
The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable prediction system that can analyze patient data and provide an early indication of heart disease risk, thereby contributing to preventive healthcare strategies.

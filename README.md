# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model

The Heart Disease Prediction Model is a machine learning-based system designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on medical and lifestyle-related factors. This model aims to assist healthcare professionals and researchers by providing early warnings and supporting preventive healthcare measures.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
⚙️ Key Features
✔ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data for better model accuracy.
✔ Feature Engineering: Selecting key attributes affecting heart disease.
✔ Machine Learning Model: Using Logistic Regression to classify individuals as high-risk or low-risk.
✔ Performance Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score.
✔ Visualization: Graphical representation of important patterns in the dataset.

🎯 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable prediction system that can analyze patient data and provide an early indication of heart disease risk, thereby contributing to preventive healthcare strategies.
